Use Cases of Regression Models in Gaming

There are common regressor models used by game analysts. Game Analysts use regression models to predict player behavior, optimise game mechanics, and improve monetization strategies.
Some commonly used regressor models include:

1. Linear Regression: This predicts numerical outcomes such as player spending or session duration.
2. Polynomial Regression: This captures non-linear trends, such as difficulty curves and skill progression
3. Random Forest Regressor: RFR handles complex interactions and non-linear relationships in player engagement.
4. Logistic Regression: Is used for binary classification, like predicting if a player will churn or stay.
